# ThingEngine

## Help the World Connect the Dots

ThingEngine is the workhorse behind Thingpedia, the open source platform for IoT rules
that you can execute anywhere you want.

This package contains the core of ThingEngine, which is concerned with
actually loading and executing the rules. It cannot be used alone, it
must be imported by one of the integration layers
([cloud](https://github.com/Stanford-IoT-Lab/thingengine-platform-cloud),
[server](https://github.com/Stanford-IoT-Lab/thingengine-platform-server)
or
[android](https://github.com/Stanford-IoT-Lab/thingengine-platform-android))

ThingEngine is part of Open Thing Platform, a research project led by
prof. Monica Lam, from Stanford University.  You can find more
information at <http://thingengine.stanford.edu/about>, and you can
find user documentation [here](/doc/main.md)
