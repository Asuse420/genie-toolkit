1.6.0-beta.1
============

* Version was bumped to 1.6 (skipping the 1.5 series) to match the rest of
  the Almond platform (thingengine-core, almond-cloud, almond-cmdline)
* Added experimental support for contextual inference: tracking of contexts,
  passing contexts to the server [#83]
* Implemented support for unresolved locations [#94, #95]
* Impleemnted support for relative time values (morning, evening)
  [Ricky Grannis-Vu; #103]
* Added a link to register a Matrix account when there is no Matrix account
  (because users might not have the account in the first place) [#89]

  safe or not [#102]
* The wording of anonymous mode error messages was improved [#102]
* Fixed displaying of contact names in permission requests [#91]
* Fixed builtin location functions [#92]
* Updated to use the new thingtalk and thingengine-core APIs [#98, #99, #100]
* Updated dependencies [#90, #104]

1.4.0
=====

* Confirmations were changed to confirm earlier if the parser is not confident
  on a certain user input [#20, #67]
* All handling of easter eggs was removed, and now lives in thingengine-core
  as a builtin function [#74]

  provides direct support for bookkeeping commands [#77]
* Added a Stop command: same as Cancel, but quiet [#26, #81]
* Added support for new output types in ThingTalk (map, sound effect). This
  requires additional support in the platform, and will fallback to plain text

  how Almond should be used [#76]

=====

* Almond now fails with a generic message if a builtin
  device is not configured [#56]

  anonymous mode [#59]
* The library was updated to work with thingengine-core 1.3.0,
  which changes how messaging devices are aggregated

  in addition to each command from the user; this can be used

  than thingengine-core, and falls back to no statistics at all
  if the module is not provided [#61]
