0.6.0-beta.1
============

* Program normalization during evaluation was improved, which should result in higher
  accuracy and fewer errors due to incorrect evaluation [#139].
* ThingTalk templates for single sentence and dialogues have been merged. This should
  have no impact on downstream users as dialogues are disabled by default, but it will
  allow us to share fixes [#138].
* The "requote" script has been refactored and fixed, and now has a mode where the
  string values are preserved in the sentence, but wrapped in quote marks [#140].
* The performance of template generation (in terms of sentence/sec) has been improved
  significantly, compared to previous unstable releases, and should be on par or better with
  the 0.5 series. This primarily affects dialogue templates, but it should improve
  single-sentence templates too [#142].
* Misc template fixes [#139, #141].

0.6.0-alpha.1
=============

* Introduce the support for programming languages other than ThingTalk.
  New programming languages can be supported by adding the relevant abstraction
  module, and then selecting it when generating data [#123].
* Added the ability to build Q&A skills for structured web data using
  schema.org markup. Genie now includes new subcommands, prefixed with "webqa-",
  which can process structured schema.org markup and produce a Thingpedia
  skill definition and implementation to answer database-style questions [#124, #130, #132, #135].
* Templates for questions were rewritten and expanded, to support a larger
  and more varied set of possible filters [#124].
* Added new command to generate multi-turn dialogue. This command supersedes
  the old "generate-contextual" command, and generates both the first turn and
  the subsequent turn of the dialogue in one shot. The "generate-contextual" command,
  and the associated command "contextualize" are now obsolete and will be removed soon [#129].
* The syntax of contextual templates have been modified, and now there is a single
  tagger function that associates one or more "tags" to each context [#129].
* Added templates for MultiWOZ dialogues. These templates target the intent-and-slot
  representation used in MultiWOZ, and generate multi-turn dialogues [#107].
* Added new templates for multi-turn ThingTalk. These templates support
  single-domain transaction-style dialogues similar to those in MultiWOZ [#129, #137].
* Added support for the new genienlp library, which includes new BERT-based
  semantic parsing and NLU models, yielding significantly higher accuracy [#137].
* Post-processing in the American English was expanded, so models using Genie are
  more robust to inconsistent punctuation and contractions.
* Added HTML templates and tools to help collect manually-annotated validation data
  on MTurk [#124].
* Added a tool to requote a training set, replacing all string spans with entities
  like QUOTED_STRING, LOCATION, etc.
* Added a command to run a simple HTTP server serving a trained Genie model, with
  an API compatible with the Almond NLP API. This allows testing a full-fledged Almond
  against a newly trained Genie model, without deploying Almond Cloud.
* The sampling algorithm used by the synthetic sentence generator was rewritten,
  and it now honors the sampling tunable a lot more closely. It is now possible to
  specify a sampling weight for every template [#129].
* The implementation of the inner-loop of the sentence generation was rewritten
  to allow more optimization by the JS engine, and has now significantly less overhead.
* Misc bug fixes [#117, #118, #119, #125, #128, #134].
* Node 8 is no longer supported. The only supported version of node is 10.*.

0.5.3

  them resolved according to their preference [#127].

Please see the beta version release notes for the full list of changes and

0.4.0-beta.1
============

Contextual support [#57, #62]:
* Added API to predict based on context.
* Added contextual templates for follow ups, incrementally adding filters, and
  answering slot-filling questions.
* Contextual sentence generation now runs in parallel using multiple threads.
  This requires a version of node compiled with worker support.
* Slot-filling answer in the templates use `bookkeeping(answer())` forms instead
  of generating new programs with the parameter slot-filled.
* Contextual evaluation now tracks "raw" string answers correctly.
* The `sample` and `mturk-validate` commands can now operate in contextual mode,
  to paraphrase contextual datasets.
* New command line tool `manual-annotate-dialog` to interactively annotate dialog
  datasets, while tracking context and answers correctly.
* New command line tool `typecheck` to typecheck a dataset, and optionally interactively
  correct it. The tool is mostly useful when the Thingpedia signatures change.
* Added MTurk template for contextual paraphrasing.

Question-Answering support [#61, #65]:
* The templates now include programs with projections, and the projections are
  preserved.
* Templates now honor the new `#[unique]` parameter annotation in ThingTalk.
* Added support for different grammatical forms of parameter `#_[canonical]` annotation.
* Added experimental templates for "who" questions, based on Wikidata.
* Added several new flags to the templates: `timer`, `projection`, `undefined_filter`,
  `projection_with_filter`, `extended_timers`.

General enhancements:
* The tokenizer client was updated to pass the full locale tag. This requires a recent
  version of almond-tokenizer, and enables distinguishing Simplified and Traditional
  Chinese [#70].
* Templates can now be packed in a self-contained ZIP file, suitable to upload
  to an instance of almond-cloud with enabled luinet. This allows one-click
  generation, training & deployment of Genie/LUInet models [#67].
* Added experimental templates for richer timers. These templates are behind a flag,
  `extended_timers`. [Ricky Grannis-Vu, #66].
* All commands now expect a `thingpedia.tt` file instead of a `thingpedia.json`
  file. The `download-snapshot` command has been updated to download the snapshot
  in ThingTalk format. Entities must be provided separately to the commands that
  need them [#58].
* Augmentation and generation now can track progress, and show a progress bar
  when called without debugging from the command line.
* Added parameter expansion for LOCATION, which soon will not be preprocessed by
  almond-tokenizer [#54].
* Added a new augmentation pass for commands that use a single device, which are
  prefixed with the device name, like in Alexa [#55].
* Fixed location of Los Angeles in the default constant file.
* Fixed parameter expansion to handle joins correctly [#69].
* Fixed support for primitive templates that include projections, aggregations
  and other complex ThingTalk operators [#68].
* Updated dependencies [#56, #59, #60, #63, #71, #79].

  when given as answers

  changes based on the previously issued commands) [#5, #6, #43, #44]
* Improved templates for Chinese [#39]
* Added enum translation for Chinese [#35]
