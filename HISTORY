1.8.0-alpha.2
=============

  a "hint" containing which filters, projections, sorting and slicing operations
  will be applied on the result. Query implementations can use the hint to reduce
  the amount of data retrieved from the server.

  server [#45, #64]
* Added a function to @builtin for easter eggs / canned replies [#58]

* PermissionManager API can now be accessed over RPC
* Platforms can now provide a custom messaging interface,
  which will be used in addition to the ones provided by configured devices [#41]
* More than one messaging device can be configured at once; this required
